# Nick Schiermeier's First CS193 Homework

My favorite things in CS193 are:
- I have friends in the class I can sit next to
- It ends early in the afternoon so I have the rest of the afternoon to chill
- The TAs that are teaching the class seem nice
- ^3/4 of them are from California like me so that's really cool since it's the best state
- I'm running out of ideas
